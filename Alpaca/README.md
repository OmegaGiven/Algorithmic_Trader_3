# Alpaca Trader

This is my dummed down version of using Alpaca Markets to trade and sell stock either with paper money or real.


Libraries Used:
1. alpaca_trade_api

How to Run:
 1. Clone or download the repository
 2. run Alpaca/main.py
 3. Let the function continually run if you want to just let it run for a standard market week.
 4. in Alpaca/config.py there is a list of stocks. you can add or take away from the list as you wish. You can also change the quantity bought and sold. I am in development to allow the program to evenly divide up your profolio rather than a hard coded quantity of stocks.
