# Alpaca Trader

This is my dummed down version of using Alpaca Markets to trade and sell stock either with paper money or real.


Libraries Used:
1. alpaca_trade_api

How to Run:
 1. Clone or download the repository
 2. Edit the main.py by adding or removing the name of stocks you want to test.
 keep in mind that stocks may have different names than normal like crypto doge is "DOGE-USD"
 3. run main.py and look at the results.
