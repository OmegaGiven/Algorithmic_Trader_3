This is my dummed down version of my MACD buy and sell based on past history.

How to Run:
 1. Clone or download the repository
 2. Edit the main.py by adding or removing the name of stocks you want to test.
 keep in mind that stocks may have different names than normal like crypto doge is "DOGE-USD"
 3. run main.py and look at the results.
